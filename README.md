# Game Programming with C# Final Assignment Simon Dunvall

**Add a short description of the intended behavior, how the game mechanic should work. I need to know what were you trying to achieve.**<br>
I choose to make the kariomart game so the intended behavior was to make a game that follows your specification. I understood the assignment like this. The player to chooses a track and to race thier friend. The cars to have to go around the tracks a couple of times to finish the game and for the player to then choose another track. So you only race against your friend who also playes with you.However I did not have time to do all nice to haves because I tried to write as good code as a posible. More than that I made my game in 3D, used the new input system, wanted to keep the code clean so that I can easily change the code in the future.

	
 **Add a short set of instructions for me, as a developer, about what do I need do to in order to take a look at your project - what scene I need to load in order to play? Do I need any additional packages to install?**<br>
Open the project in unity and click play in the editor and the right scene should load. That is the MainMenu scene just so you know but if you take the code from github everytinh should work.

	
**Describe quickly the structure of your code and the thinking behind design.**<br>

	
**Add a short list if instructions about how to play the game like, for example, the key mappings and what do they do**<br>
Click start game in the main menu than just choose the track you want to play. The keymaps are wasd and arrowkeys for forward, right, reverse and left. Car one has wasd car two has the arrowkeys. If you want to pause the game than you can use esc and either resume or go back to the main menu. 

	
**Add a list of sources of inspiration - you don't need to cover all of them, just the ones that helped.**<br>


	
**Add the Unity version for the project**<br>
2022.3.9f1

 
**Add your name to the project**<br>
